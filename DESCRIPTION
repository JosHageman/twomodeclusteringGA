Description: Implements two-mode clustering (biclustering) using 
    genetic algorithms. The method was first introduced in 
    Hageman et al. (2008) <doi:10.1007/s11306-008-0105-7>. The 
    package provides tools for fitting, visualization, and 
    validation of two-mode cluster structures in data matrices.
